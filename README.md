# T-Time [WIP]

This is a remake of an older version of my Boston MBTA train tracker site. 
It is still a work in progress - but the basic features are there:
Currently:
- Displays live trains, lines, and stations
- Refreshes frequently with near-accurate coordinates and bearing
To be added:
- Detailed info and schedules for each train when clicked
- Filter by line
- Route creation/planning

### To use
